PC Control of the LED for the 2048-like installation
====================================================

This is the code to run on the PC to control the LEDs.

It is composed of two modules:
* A game server `game.py` to handle the game and forge instructions for the LEDs.
* A LED server `leds_server.py` which waits for instructions and send them to the LEDs.

Both of them communicate _via_ the network. You should edit parameters in caps in the two previous files to match your configuration.

The game server uses a game controller to get events and update its status. These are located in `game_controllers/`. The most basic one is `KeyboardController` which simply listen for keypress on the arrow keys. It can be used as an example for more sophisticated one.

## Usage

1. Launch the LED server: `./leds_server.py SERIAL_PORT` where `SERIAL_PORT` is the one used to communicate with the LEDs.
2. Launch the game server: `./game.py HOST` where `HOST` is the host for the LED server.
3. Play
