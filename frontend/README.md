# 256

This is a modified version of [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) for our project.

It runs exactly as the original one. Modifications are:
* Smaller goal (256 instead of 2048) because it runs on a 3x3 board instead of 4x4.
* Send AJAX queries to the server to use it as a controller for our setup.
